Blend is a PHP/MySQL based content management system that has been developed to power my new portfolio & blog. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core functionality is under the system/ folder which follows the MVC pattern. 

'application/' contains the core functionality (URL routing, theme loading, etc..) for the CMS. 

'controller/' contains the controllers for the front end site, the 'admin/' directory contains all the controllers for the admin functionality. 

'model/' contains all functionality for managing the database, which contains support for blog posts, categories, portfolio items, comments, settings, users and more. 

'themes/' directory has any front end site themes, and the backend CMS themes are stores in 'system/themes'.
